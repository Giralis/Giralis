### Hello, my name is Vladimir and I'm a curious self-taught developer who one day wants to lead his own team.

## I've already used or read about:
    - UIKit, ARKit
    - MVC, MVVM, VIPER
    - CocoaPods, SPM
    - SwiftyJSON, Alamofire

  I was learning Swift with:
    - 📚 Apple's "Develop in Swift" Books
    - 💻 Paul Hudson's "Hacking with Swift"
    - 🌐 Various internet guides
    - 🐂 Own motivation!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an app to manage a dance school.
- ⚡ I study new things regularly, but my favourite is (trying 😅) to play piano.
